   Over the years, numerous frameworks have been proposed for causal inference. In this paper, we draw connections between the classical framework of causality of sturcutral causal models (SCMs) \cite{pearl2000causality}, the string diagrammatic framework due to \cite{fong2013causal}, \cite{fritz2023free}, and a relatively new measure theoretic framework set forth in \cite{axioms-1}.
